18. Describe the procedure of marking badblocks in Ext2/3/4 FS(including the tools that are needed).

e2fsck -c <device>
e2fsck is a fsck(file system check) program used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file systems.

-c
This option causes e2fsck to use badblocks(8) program to do a read-only scan of the device in order 
to find any bad blocks. If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block inode to 
prevent them from being allocated to a file or directory. If this option is specified twice (-cc), 
then the bad block scan will be done using a non-destructive read-write test.  

  
badblocks is a Linux utility used to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a disk partition).
